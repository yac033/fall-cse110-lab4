1. it will print 3 because i is declear by using 'var' which can be access outside of the for loop
2. will print 150 because var doesn't care about being declear mutiple times
3. will print 150 because Math.round(150 * 100)=15000 / 100 = 150
4. [50, 100 150] it loop the prices array and mutiple with 0.5 the number times it with 100 and put it through the round function (which it doesn't change anything because all the number is a whole number) divided it by 100 which just give us the price * 0.5 and then push the number indiviually to the end of the discounted array.
5. error because i only decleared in for loop can't access it outside of the for loop
6. error because discountedPrice only decleared in for loop can't access it outside of the for loop
7. [50, 100 150] it loop the prices array and mutiple with 0.5 the number times it with 100 and put it through the round function (which it doesn't change anything because all the number is a whole number) divided it by 100 which just give us the price * 0.5 and then push the number indiviually to the end of the discounted array. and since line 14 is in the same block as let so the line can run normally
8. error because discounted price is being declear mutiple time syntext error
9. error because i only decleared in for loop can't access it outside of the for loop
10. 3 because line 12 is in the same block as the length being declear
11. [50, 50, 50] because the discountedPrice is const and the first time when it got declear is 100 * (0.5) which is 50 and it push into the discounted array 3 times
